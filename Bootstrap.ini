| MDT "ZTI" - settings for "Zero Touch Imaging".
| These settings make it zero touch imaging, you can pick the task to install and name the computer what you want or leave the default generated name. 
| If you want to revert to a semi ZTI, just make a couple changes to the customsettings to assign the task, change YES to NO for the following: "SkipTaskSequence" and "SkipComputerName".
| I commented on what they all do, if you google around, there is a lot more you can do with it as far as ZTI and other settings.
| Place these in the following location, then update your deployment share. "..\DeploymentShare\Control"

[Settings]
; when the computer boots, it checks things based on the priority you set. MDT is spart enough to know what the default gateway of a computer is (thankfully)
; the Default Gateway includes setting the deployment share deployroot, then it moves to the default section.
Priority=DefaultGateway,Default

[DefaultGateway]
; set locations based off of computer ip addresses and/or vlans while booting the
; it's almost similar to setting varriables where UNC or IP=Location than referenced like a GOTO option.
; this is very helpful if you have DFS or something to replicate the initial deployment share to other sites.
; example: 10.8.4.9=test_ip
ip/unc=location_1
ip/unc=location_2
ip/unc=location_3
and so on

[location_1]
; unc path to server hosting the deploymentshare for that location.
; my network is a bitch at the moment, so I had to use the ip address of the file server hosting the deploymentshare.
DeployRoot=\\0.0.0.0\IT\DeploymentShare

[location_2]
DeployRoot=\\0.0.0.0\IT\DeploymentShare

[location_3]
DeployRoot=\\0.0.0.0\IT\DeploymentShare


[Default]
; use a non expiring service account to connect to the networkshare
UserID=S-MDT-NetworkAccess
; use a password generator that is like 12-20 characters and is random as hell.
UserPassword=%RANDOM-PASS%
; only use the FQDN to be safe
UserDomain=servername.example.local

; inital settings are set in here, and lots of others are in the customsettings.ini file.
